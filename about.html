            <p>
                <abbr title="Vaniah's Taco Shop">VTS</abbr> was founded in <time datetime="1964">1964</time>. Our shop
                was built from a <strong>love of tacos</strong> 🌮❤️❤️🌮. Lemme tell you a brief summary of the
                history.✨✨
            </p>
            <p>
                At Kiambu, we're not just about tacos; we're about good times, great conversations, and mouthwatering
                Mexican cuisine.
                Our story began in 1964, when my grandparents opened their very first taco shop. They believed in
                serving freshly made
                Mexican food that captured the essence of our tradition, since we were Native Mexicans🙂
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2013, I had a similar vision: to bring freshly crafted tacos directly to your home. Our secret lies
                in the simplicity
                of our ingredients. We use delicious meats like carne asada, pollo asado, and the spicy pork delight
                known as adobada.
                These flavorful fillings are nestled in warm corn tortillas, creating a symphony of taste.
            </p>

            <p>
